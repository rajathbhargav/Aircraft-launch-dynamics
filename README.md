# Aircraft-launch-dynamics
Simulate take-off characteristics for an propeller driven aircraft

"aero-hand.py" - This code simulates the take-off dynamics of a propreller-driven hand-launched aircraft
By default the loop is rigged to iterate through a range of thrust values and to break at the least thrust required to achieve an un-eventful launch
The loop can be modified to iterate for any other parameter and optimize that


"aero-run.py" - This code simulates the take-off dynamics of a propreller-driven aircraft on a runway
By default the loop is rigged to iterate through a range of thrust values and to break at the least thrust required to achieve an un-eventful launch
The loop can be modified to iterate for any other parameter and optimize that
